#NoteToSelf
my education never stopped, my gorwth never stopped, it hasnt finished

i am discovering me every day with limitations and powers,

i am becoming me every day with addon and new layers 

My existence is pushing my ego, yet i am trying to strech my servant towel

i want it to exist more than my ego, i want my ego to be less than my towel

i looking for that broom to clean every day , of quirks , of fake ego

i want to clean it every day , so i become a mirrow that always tells the truth

i want to be like that shadow that never leaves... 

perfume that is subtle but always there in existence to lift your mood and your spirits

That makes you to fall in love all over again...
