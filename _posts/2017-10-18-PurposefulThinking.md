#NoteToSelf

I have made my peace, emptied my buckets...

I have emptied my quirks, pulled out my pockets...

I have nothing that drags me, pulls me, or holds me down

I smile more, live more , at times die more but no more frown

I pray more , love more , wait more, endure in silence more

I own more, more of faults, more of my mistakes, patience galore

I fail more, i try more, listen more, i try harder more,

I fail again , i try more again, i push more, failure is accepted

Not accepted as an impedence to my growth, my studies might have finished

My education never stopped, my gorwth never stopped, it hasnt finished

I am discovering me every day with limitations and powers,

I am becoming me every day with addon and new layers 

My existence is pushing my ego, yet i am trying to strech my servant towel

I want it to exist more than my ego, i want my ego to be less than my towel

I looking for that broom to clean every day , of quirks , of fake ego

I want to clean it every day , so i become a mirrow that always tells the truth

That makes you to fall in love all over again...
