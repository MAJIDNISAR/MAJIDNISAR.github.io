# Where is Noah's Ark In Kashmir

Floods in Jammu and Kashmir have become a recurring problem, with little progress made in terms of disaster preparedness and infrastructure development since 2014. The recent turmoil and conflict in the region has only made the situation worse, with inadequate infrastructure and lack of proper planning exacerbating the impact of heavy rainfall. The region has seen a number of devastating floods in recent years, with significant loss of life and property damage. Despite this, there have been no significant changes in terms of disaster preparedness and infrastructure development in Jammu and Kashmir. The region continues to be ill-equipped to deal with floods, with inadequate flood protection barriers, and insufficient evacuation plans in place. Emergency supplies are also not readily available, leaving those affected by floods with little support.

In conclusion, the floods in Jammu and Kashmir continue to be a major problem, with little progress made in terms of disaster preparedness and infrastructure development since 2014. The region remains ill-equipped to deal with floods, leaving those affected by the disaster with little support. It is essential that immediate steps be taken to address this issue and prevent further loss of life and property damage. The lessons from the story of Noah's Ark and the Islamic and Quranic perspective provide valuable guidance for individuals and communities as they prepare for and respond to floods. By taking these lessons to heart, we can work together to minimize the impact of floods and support those who are affected
