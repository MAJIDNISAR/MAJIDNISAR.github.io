> Spring Will Find a way,

> It Always Has ...

> Through the Closed-Doors,

> our shops & Homes,

> It Always Has ...

>
> Spring Will Find a way,

> It Always Has ...

> Through the Home-turned-Lockups,

> Our Beloved Homes...

> It Always Has...

> Spring will Find a way,

> It Always Has...

> where is the Noah's Boat,

> It Always Has...


> Spring Will Find a Way,

> Through the Autumns,

> our Chinars, a flame within us

> It Always Has ...

>
> Spring Will Find a Way,

> Through the Winters,

> A cover over our martyrs, 

> those graves are still there,

> It Always Has ...

> Spring Will Find a Way,

> Through the Blood-oozing,

> seeping to  bedrock of our conscience,

> It Always Has ...
>
> Spring will Find a way,

> through the Bullets & Pellets,

> the wounds never go away,

> they are still there,

> It Always Has ...
