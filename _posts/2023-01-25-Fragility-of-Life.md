# Fragility of Life!

> Life is fragile, like a delicate flower
> Born to bloom, but wilt in an hour
> A fleeting moment, a flicker of light
> Gone in a blink, without a fight

> A butterfly's wings, so thin and frail
> A gust of wind, and it's on the trail
> Of a journey, that it may not complete
> A reminder of life's uncertain feet

> A spark of hope, a flicker of dreams
> Easily snuffed out, like a candle beams
> But still we hold on, to what we know
> That life is fragile, and yet it glows

> So let us treasure, each day we're given
> For life is fragile, and all too brief
> And though we may not see the end
> Let us live it well, with love and belief
