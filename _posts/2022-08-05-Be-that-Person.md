# Be the person you would want to meet!

Belive starts with Be!

> Be the person you would want to meet,
> With kindness in your eyes and a smile so sweet.
> Look in the mirror and see the best,
> Be the person you would want yourself to be impressed.

> Be the light in someone's dark day,
> Be the love that guides them on their way.
> Be the hope that gives them strength,
> Be the person that makes a difference at any length.

> Be the person you would want to know,
> Be the one that others look up to and admire so.
> Be the person that you would want to find,
> Be the one that leaves a positive impact on the mind.

> So look in the mirror, see the person you can be,
> And always strive to be the best version of you, you'll see.
> Be the person you would want yourself to meet,
> And the world will be a brighter place with your kindness so sweet.
