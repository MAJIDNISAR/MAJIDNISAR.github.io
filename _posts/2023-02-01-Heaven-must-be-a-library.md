# Heaven Must Be a Library

Heaven, a place of peace and light,  
A realm beyond our earthly sight.  
Where souls do bask in blissful grace,  
And every heart finds a resting place.  

Yet what if heaven holds a treasure,  
A wealth of knowledge beyond measure?  
A library, a place of books and lore,  
Where every tome doth always pour.  

The shelves with wisdom doth overflow,  
A sea of stories we may come to know.  
The quills of scribes and sages too,  
Inscribed with truths and visions new.  

Indeed, the books within this hall,  
Do hold the secrets of us all.  
Of knowledge, love, and wisdom divine,  
The words that shine with truth and shine. 

The pages speak of life's true worth,  
And guide us to a better birth.  
Of joys and sorrows, pain and pride,  
And all the passions that do bide. 

The tomes of wisdom, clear and wise,  
Do teach us how to learn and rise.  
To lead a life that's good and true,  
And follow dreams that come to view. 

And then there's love, the greatest treasure,  
The bond that binds us all together.  
In verse and prose, its tale is told,  
A story of a love worth more than gold. 

So let us seek within these halls,  
The knowledge that our souls shall install.  
For in these books, we'll find the way,  
To lead our hearts to heaven each day.
