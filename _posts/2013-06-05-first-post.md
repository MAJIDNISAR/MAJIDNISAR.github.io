Asalamu Alaikum, (peace) / Hi,
My Name is Majid Nisar,

I welcome you all, to my website/blog, its been quite a while since i thought i should do this, and here now its out.. this is a start towards a change, i believe the biggest room, in this world is the room for improvement and what starts improvement, is change, not change the world for the start, lets start by introspection, only then we can know where we are and then we can ascertain where we want to be and the way forward.

With those words, i would again welcome you to an experience… a journey we will embark upon, where we are not focusing our entire energy on the destination but a major part of it… to the journey and experience, hence will be a learning curve for us.
