#NoteToSelf
***
&quot; **Don&#39;t Just Inspire to make a Living, Inspire to make a Difference** ,

Anything you want, good, you can have, claim it, work hard to get it,

 When you get it, reach back, pull someone else up. Help someone!

Each One Teach One...

Just because you are doing a lot more, doesn&#39;t mean you are getting lot more done!

Don&#39;t Confuse Movement with progress!&quot;

So have dream but have goals, life goals, yearly goals, monthly goals, daily goals Understand! To achieve these goals you must apply discipline and consistency!

In order to achieve your goals, you must apply discipline and consistency, every day, not just on Tuesday, and miss a few days, you have to work at it, every day, you have to plan every day, we don&#39;t plan to fail, we fail to plan, hard works!

Working really hard is what successful people do!

 â€• Denzel Washington

We all assume things will get better, let me tell you something about assumption... Assumption is a huge disappointment

Here is the hard truth, People don&#39;t necessarily want you to succeed!

And the bigger your dream, the more people are going to come out of woodwork to stop you.

 As Oliver Emberton once said, &quot;The only way to avoid pissing people off, is to do nothing important&quot;, but if you are striving for something important,if you are trying to make real change, If there is something in your life, you are absolutely hell-bent to make happen, you have got to understand that you are going to be fighting against something.

People are going to be pushing back against you and it&#39;s going to be your ability to hold true to that vision, that&#39;s going to determine whether you can pull it off.

As Victor Hugo said, &quot;You have enemies, GOOD! Means you stood for something at some point in your life&quot;

Having a vision, already puts you in an incredibly rare group of people, being able to see something what other people can&#39;t see, that is the role of visionary, is literally to interpret the world that other people don&#39;t even know exists!

And bring it to fruition.

Keep away from those who belittle your ambitions small people always do that, but the really great ones, they make you believe, you too can become great.-Mark Twain

Paint the world not as it is, but as it could be...

Thats when one can make change!
