#NoteToSelf
***
"Dont Just Inspire to make a Living , Inspire to make a Difference,
Any thing you want ,Good, you can have , claim it , work hard to get it, 
when you get it,reach back, pull some one else  up
Each One Teach One...
Just because you are doing a lot more , doesnt mean you are getting lot more done!
Dont Confuse Movement with progress!..."
SO have dream but have goals, life goals , yearly goals , monthly goals , daily goals
Understand to achieve these goals  you must apply discipline and consistency!
In order to acheive your goals, you must apply discipline and consistency, everyday, 
not just on tuesday, and miss a few days,you have to work at it,every day , you have to plan everyday,
we dont plan to fail,we fail to plan, 
Hard works works!
Working really hard is what successful people do!
â€• Danzel Washington 
We all assume things get better, let me tell you something about assumption...
Assumption is a huge disappointment

Here is the hard truth
People don't necessarily want you to succeed!
and the bigger your dream...
the more people are going to come out of woodwork to stop you
As Oliver Amberton once said,"The only way to avoid pissing people off, is to do nothing important",
but if you are striving for something important... if you are trying to make real change...
If there is something in your life , you are absolutely hellbent to make happen,
you have gotto understand that you are going to be fighting against something..
people are going to be pushing back against  you ...
and its going to be your ability to hold true to that vision...
thats going to determine whether you can pull it off...
as victor hugo said ,"You have enemies ,GOOD!, means you stood for something at somepoint in your life"

Having a vision, alredy puts you in a incredibly rare group of people,being able to see somthing what other people cant see,
that is the role of visionary, is literally to interpret the world , that other people dont even know exists!
and bring it to fruition.

Keep away from those who belittle your ambitions
small people always do that ,
but the really great ones, they make you believe,
you too can become great.. -Mark Twain

Paint the world not as it is, but as it could be...
that when one can make change!
